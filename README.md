## Machine Learning - Bike Share (Washington DC)

- In this project, it was my intention to delve deeper into the machine learning with a new kaggle dataset.
- Cross-validation on several models was used to find the optimal model, followed by grid-search to tweek the hyperparameters.
- Our aim was to find the number of bikes needed daily with respect to data of the past 2 years. 
- Attributes were 
        - weather, 
        - temperature
        - no. acquired by casual customers
        - no. acquired by registered customers
        - timestamp
        - season

 - In my solution I used regressors to calculate the no. acquired by customers and registered seperately, and then summed them together.
